The user will tell you a doc when they give you this command. Go find that doc (usually an md file), and notice the diff since the last commit, unless they are more specific (something like, from a commit 3 days ago). Use the diff to infer how the documentation change, unless it is clear, ask clarifying questions to the user, specify to them what you think needs to change. Then implement those changes
