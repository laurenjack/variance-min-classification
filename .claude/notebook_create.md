Go to the catalog-relevance repo and go to catalog-relevance/notebooks/manual_analysis/examples/relevance_events_sample.py to see an example of the kind of notebook you need to create. Look at the catalog-relevance/catalog_relevance/datasets/registry.py to see all the datasets the user might mention. You can use the MCP tool find_schema to get the schema for any of those datasets. If the user mentions running the notebook use /databricks_run Do not take unneccessary Spark actions in the notebook, just take the actions the user asks for.
